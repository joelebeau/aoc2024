# Advent of Code 2024

2nd year of doing this. Let's see if I stick past day 4 this time around.

Last year I was trying to learn Go. Now I've been doing Go as my day job for a few months, so I'm going to stick with it to see how it feels.

I'm not committing to anything clean here. There's going to be plent of quick and dirty here.
